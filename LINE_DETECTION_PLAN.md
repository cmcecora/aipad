# Padel Court Line Detection Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a phased approach to implementing real-time padel court line detection for the calibration feature. Currently, the app has a working UI with red guide lines that should turn green when aligned with actual court lines, but lacks the computer vision backend to detect real lines.

## Current State Analysis

### ✅ What's Working
- Camera integration with `expo-camera`
- UI overlay with red guide lines (3 lines: top back wall, center line, service line)
- Animation and visual feedback system
- Line alignment validation logic structure
- Stable rendering without flashing

### ❌ What's Missing
- **Real computer vision line detection** (currently returns empty array)
- **Frame processing pipeline** for camera data
- **Edge detection algorithms** (Canny, Hough Transform)
- **Performance optimization** for mobile devices
- **Real-time frame analysis**
